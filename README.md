"Specification"


"Your task at hand is to create a SQLite database for Union Square Donuts from scratch, as by writing a set of CREATE TABLE statements in a schema.sql file. The implementation details are up to you, though you should minimally ensure that your database meets the team’s expectations and that it can represent the sample data.

Expectations
To understand the team’s expectations for their database, you sat down to talk with them after the shop closed for the day.

Ingredients
We certainly need to keep track of our ingredients. Some of the typical ingredients we use include flour, yeast, oil, butter, and several different types of sugar. Moreover, we would love to keep track of the price we pay per unit of ingredient (whether it’s pounds, grams, etc.).

Donuts
We’ll need to include our selection of donuts, past and present! For each donut on the menu, we’d love to include three things:

The name of the donut
Whether the donut is gluten-free
The price per donut
Oh, and it’s important that we be able to look up the ingredients for each of the donuts!

Orders
We love to see customers in person, though we realize a good number of people might order online nowadays. We’d love to be able to keep track of those online orders. We think we would need to store:

An order number, to keep track of each order internally
All the donuts in the order
The customer who placed the order. We suppose we could assume only one customer places any given order.


Customers
Oh, and we realize it would be lovely to keep track of some information about each of our customers. We’d love to remember the history of the orders they’ve made. In that case, we think we should store:

A customer’s first and last name
A history of their orders


Sample Data
Your database should be able to represent…

Cocoa, for which Union Square Donuts pays $5.00 for one pound.
Sugar, for which Union Square Donuts pays $2.00 for one pound.
Union Square Donuts’ “Belgian Dark Chocolate” donut, which is not gluten-free, costs $4.00, and includes the following ingredients:
Cocoa
Flour
Buttermilk
Sugar
Union Square Donuts’ “Back-To-School Sprinkles” donut, which is not gluten-free, costs $4.00, and includes the following ingredients:
Flour
Buttermilk
Sugar
Sprinkles
Order 1 from Luis Singh for 3 Belgian Dark Chocolate donuts and 2 Back-To-School Sprinkles donuts.

Usage
To create a database from your schema, within your donuts folder, type

sqlite3 donuts.db
The above will create an empty SQLite database called donuts.db.

Then, in the sqlite3 prompt, type

.read schema.sql
to read the statements from schema.sql.

Recall you can use DROP TABLE tablename, where tablename is the name of your table, to delete a table from your database."
